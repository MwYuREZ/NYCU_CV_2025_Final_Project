[Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)
## Description  
Cassava is a vital food crop in Africa, especially for smallholder farmers, as it thrives in harsh conditions. However, viral diseases significantly reduce yields, affecting over 80% of cassava-growing households in Sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional disease detection relies on expert inspections, which are costly, labor-intensive, and scarce.

This competition aims to use data science to improve cassava disease diagnosis. Provided 21,367 labeled images from a survey in Uganda—most crowdsourced from farmers and annotated by experts at NaCRRI and Makerere University. The dataset reflects real-world conditions, including mobile-quality images and low bandwidth constraints.

Our task is to classify each cassava leaf image into one of four disease categories or as healthy. Accurate, accessible detection could empower farmers to act early and protect their crops.
